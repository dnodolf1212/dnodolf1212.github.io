When I was young I was artistic and spent most of my time trying to make things.  As I learned and made mistakes I found that you can approach almost anything with an artistic perspective and create something new or fix an old problem. When I went skateboarding I found new ways to approach my concrete surroundings. In art school, I used a computer to render a complex diagram and then screenprint it onto whatever I wanted. In the kitchen, there are a million ways to make toast taste like the ultimate piece of cooked bread. So when considering why I decided to become a software engineer I guess the answer is to gain a new perspective. 
I have been a working chef for about 10 years and while the service industry offers opportunities to be creative and innovate, alot of the monotony and physical demands take a toll on a persons health. But inherent in kitchen work is the idea that everything must be in its place and the end result can be considered artistically beautiful. As with coding, the typed chartacters and their syntax follow some rigorous organizational rules but the end result can produce something quite significant. 
I think my main goal for coding school is to work with software that helps people be creative. For me, the cliche of the the starving artist only holds for people who need help producing their vision. If we can produce an interative environment for an artist to better create, we can move aside the obstacles the sculptor or painter were confronted with using our shared digital means. Without dismissing the paint brush or the block of clay as useful artistic media, what if we can help the artist manifest their vision that much faster with a few lines of code?
